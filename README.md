# Heart-Attack-Analysis-Prediction
In this project, I will go through all the steps necessary for predicting heart attack chance for a patient. 
The steps include:  
1. Data Cleaning: missing values with statistical analysis as well as detect outliers
2. Feature Engineering : choose features with correlation, converted categorical features
3. Scale the data : Applied MinMax, Z-score, MaxAbs, Quantile, Log Transformation to see the which one is best
4. Model Training & Testing Data : Applied KNN, Logistic Regression with KFold, Linear Classification on both test and train data
5. Plot Training Accuracy : Plotting the accuracy of the above algorithms to check which model works best for dataset. As well as applied scaling technique on the best model to choose which model and scaling method to choose for test data for aquiring best accuracy
6. Test Output Prediction : Applied KFOLD with Logistic Regression on test data
7. Best Test Accuracy : Achieved 86% of accuracy
